Fluxzero is a cloud-native runtime and SDK designed to simplify backend development by allowing engineers to focus
exclusively on business logic.

By treating all interactions, such as commands, queries, and web traffic, as messages, the
platform eliminates the need for traditional boilerplate like plumbing, infrastructure configuration, and complex
framework wiring.

The system utilizes event sourcing and a built-in search engine to manage state and data retrieval
automatically, ensuring applications are scalable and observable by default.

Developers can verify their work using a streamlined test fixture that simulates message flows without requiring external mocks or databases.

Fluxzero Cloud further reduces operational friction by offering a managed environment for instant deployment via GitHub Actions.

Ultimately, Fluxzero aims to usher in a "Logic Era" where software is defined by pure intent rather than technical scaffolding.
