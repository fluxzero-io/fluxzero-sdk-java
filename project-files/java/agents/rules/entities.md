# Models and state

Use `@Model` for persisted domain state. Do not introduce `@Aggregate` in new code. Existing aggregate APIs are legacy
Fluxzero 1.x compatibility surfaces and are scheduled for deprecation in 2.0.

## Core rules

1. Implement model state as immutable records or value objects.
2. Put action-specific `@AssertLegal`, `@InterceptApply` and `@Apply` methods on the command/update payload by default.
3. Keep `@Apply` pure and deterministic. It is reused during event sourcing.
4. Do not load, search, publish or perform I/O from `@Apply`.
5. Choose every model boundary by lifecycle first. State that can be created, changed, retained, deleted, or whose
   history matters independently is a separate `@Model`, even when it is normally placed in a parent's collection.
6. Treat a meaningful identity, separate retention, or independent updates as evidence for that boundary, not as
   competing criteria. A child without a globally unique functional ID can use `@EntityId(parentScoped = true)`.
7. Use `@Member` only when creation, every change, history, stream, document, cache, retention, and deletion all
   deliberately belong to the root. Collection shape, searchability, storage choice, and update frequency never make
   independently living state a member.
8. Use typed `Id<T>` values. The exact `Id.toString()` is the persisted model identity.

## Define a model

```java
@Model(searchable = true)
public record Project(
        @EntityId ProjectId projectId,
        ProjectDetails details,
        UserId ownerId) {
}

public final class ProjectId extends Id<Project> {
    public ProjectId(String value) {
        super(value, "project-");
    }
}
```

Important settings:

- `eventSourced`: controls the current-state load route. Events are still stored when `false`.
- `searchable`: maintains an independently searchable synchronous current-state document. `false` suppresses only the
  model's own collection; an explicit `@Parent(pathInParent = "...")` still retains a private graph-component document.
- `searchProjection`: optional `@Searchable` configuration for the direct collection and timestamp paths.
- `eventPublication`: controls whether unchanged transitions create an event.
- `publicationStrategy`: `STORE_AND_PUBLISH`, `STORE_ONLY`, `PUBLISH_ONLY` or `NEVER`.
- `snapshotPeriod` and `maxSnapshotCount`: event-sourcing optimizations.
- `cached` and `cachingDepth`: current and previous revisions retained in the SDK cache.
- `automaticHandling`: opt out when an explicit command handler must call `Fluxzero.assertAndApply`.
- `materializeGraph`: enables the optional durable whole-tree read model.
- `graphProjection`: optional advanced `@GraphProjection` configuration; its collection defaults to
  `<resolved model collection>-graphs` and materializes the complete finite graph without implicit size limits.

`eventSourced = false` does not disable event storage or publication. It means current state loads from the direct
document. Historical event-boundary loads still use stored model events.

## Apply actions

Creation:

```java
public record CreateProject(ProjectId projectId,
                            ProjectDetails details) {
    @Apply
    Project apply(Sender sender) {
        return new Project(
                projectId, details, sender.userId());
    }
}
```

Update:

```java
public record RenameProject(ProjectId projectId,
                            String name) {
    @Apply
    Project apply(Project project) {
        return new Project(
                projectId,
                project.details().withName(name),
                project.ownerId());
    }
}
```

Logical deletion:

```java
public record DeleteProject(ProjectId projectId) {
    @Apply
    Project apply(Project project) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Returning `null` deletes the current value but still stores/publishes the update according to the model policy. Do not
use `void` for model applies.

`@Apply` compatibility checks are inferred:

- A factory without current state requires the model to be absent.
- A non-null current-model parameter requires it to exist.
- `@Nullable` allows either state.
- Use `disableCompatibilityCheck = true` only for deliberate advanced behavior.

Fluxzero automatically handles commands with applicable model applies. Do not add a pass-through `@HandleCommand`.
Use an explicit handler only for real orchestration:

```java
@HandleCommand
CompletableFuture<Void> handle(ImportProject command) {
    // Orchestrate external work, then execute one model commit.
    return Fluxzero.assertAndApplyAsync(command);
}
```

Fluxzero commits automatically. Only when a later step in the same handling context must force an already produced
automatic Model commit to durability, use `Fluxzero.commit()` and compose on its returned `CompletableFuture<Void>`.
It is a release of the existing commit, not another mutation path: repeated calls share its completion, automatic
commit remains enabled, and a context without pending changes completes without Runtime transport. Do not call or wait
on it inside `@Apply`; the apply has not returned its change yet.

## Assertions and interceptors

```java
public record RenameProject(ProjectId projectId,
                            String name) {
    @AssertLegal
    void assertOwner(Project project, Sender sender) {
        if (!project.ownerId().equals(sender.userId())) {
            throw ProjectErrors.unauthorized;
        }
    }

    @InterceptApply
    Object ignoreNoChange(Project project) {
        return project.details().name().equals(name)
                ? null : this;
    }

    @Apply
    Project apply(Project project) {
        return project.withDetails(
                project.details().withName(name));
    }
}
```

Returning `null` from `@InterceptApply` suppresses that update. Assertions, interceptors and applies may inject every
direct target and related ancestor resolved for the action. They must not perform nested model writes.

## Combine payload and Model handlers

Keep action-specific handlers on the payload. Put genuinely cross-cutting state behavior on the Model when several
payload types share it. If both owners have an applicable handler, Fluxzero always evaluates the payload phase before
the Model phase for each annotation family:

1. payload `@InterceptApply`, then Model `@InterceptApply`;
2. payload immediate `@AssertLegal`, then Model immediate `@AssertLegal`;
3. all payload `@Apply` results, then all Model `@Apply` results;
4. payload `afterHandler = true` assertions, then Model after-handler assertions.

`priority` orders handlers only within a phase. Model applies receive the complete intermediate state produced by all
payload applies. This lets an instance Model apply finalize a newly created Model and makes multi-Model finalization
independent of Model-handler iteration order. Both phases are reduced to one atomic `Change` per Model ID. Static Model
applies remain valid; an independent static creation factory is used only when the payload did not already create its
target. Keep every phase pure and deterministic because live handling, retry, rebase and replay share this route.

## Multi-model commits

One payload can read and update unrelated models:

```java
public record ReserveStock(
        OrderId orderId,
        InventoryId inventoryId,
        int quantity) {
    @AssertLegal
    void assertAvailable(Inventory inventory) {
        if (inventory.available() < quantity) {
            throw InventoryErrors.insufficientStock;
        }
    }

    @Apply
    Order apply(Order order) {
        return order.reserve(quantity);
    }

    @Apply
    Inventory apply(Inventory inventory) {
        return inventory.reserve(quantity);
    }
}
```

The SDK loads all targets at one state boundary and commits their events, direct documents, snapshots and relationship
deltas as one model commit. The event is globally published once.

Typed IDs resolve automatically. If two payload properties refer to the same model type, qualify the model parameter:

```java
@Apply
Account apply(@Association("sourceId") Account source) {
    return source.debit(amount);
}
```

## Batch-local command consistency

Automatic model commands in one tracking batch and ordered routing segment have read-your-writes. A later command sees
an earlier staged model update, including changed parent and ancestor relations, before the earlier commit completes.
When their read/write sets overlap, the later command waits for the predecessor's durable result and is then
reevaluated against canonical state before committing. Predecessor failure fails the dependent chain. Unrelated model
chains remain parallel.

Do not treat this as one transaction across commands: each command retains its own atomic commit, result and conflict
policy. Different consumers or routing segments have no implied ordering; configure a shared consumer and routing key
when that order is a domain requirement.

## Relationships

Use `@Parent` on the child:

```java
@Model(searchable = true)
public record Task(
        @EntityId TaskId taskId,
        @Parent(pathInParent = "tasks") ProjectId projectId,
        TaskDetails details,
        boolean completed) {
}
```

The child remains an independent Model because its lifecycle is independent; `@Parent` expresses graph placement and
default cascade ownership. Being displayed below or deleted with the parent does not make it a `@Member`.

- Updating `projectId` moves the task.
- The parent and siblings do not need to load for a task-only change.
- Typed `Id<Parent>` supplies the relation type. A role is only needed for untyped/ambiguous IDs.
- `pathInParent` is a stable public graph-placement and serialization contract. A pathless relation remains available through
  typed `Graph` traversal and parent-deletion lifecycle handling, but is not emitted as a named JSON graph edge.
- A child is logically deleted by default when any parent referenced by that `@Parent` is finally deleted. Set
  `deleteOnParentDeletion = false` for deliberately detached or independently retained children.
- Relationships are temporal; graph reconstruction can pin a `stateIndex`.
- Same-type recursion is supported. A `Folder` may hold
  `@Parent(pathInParent = "folders") FolderId parentFolderId`; Fluxzero accepts an arbitrarily deep tree and atomically rejects
  a concrete cycle. This remains a relation between independent Models, not an embedded recursive object.

Inject parents and further ancestors into assertions, interceptors and applies:

```java
@AssertLegal
void assertOpen(
        Task task,
        @Association("tasks") Project parent,
        Portfolio grandparent) {
    // Read-only ancestor dependencies.
}
```

Use `@Association` when the relation/path or same-type target would otherwise be ambiguous.

Every root and descendant in a materialized Graph retains its own serialized type and `@Revision`. The ordinary
serializer upcasts nodes independently and lazily; do not create a Graph-wide upcaster. Use
`@HandleDocument(modelGraph = Root.class)` and return the complete Graph only when evolved node JSON must be persisted
back into the derived projection. That operation must preserve the root, state boundary, nodes and placements and does
not modify direct Models, histories or relationships.

## Embedded members

`@Model` plus `@Member` is the intentional shared-stream option:

```java
@Model(searchable = true)
public record Invoice(
        @EntityId InvoiceId invoiceId,
        @Member List<InvoiceLine> lines) {
}

public record InvoiceLine(
        @EntityId LineId lineId,
        BigDecimal amount) {
}
```

Choose this only if each line has no meaningful lifecycle outside its invoice: creation, every change, history,
retention and deletion all belong to the root. If any of those concerns can diverge, use a separate `@Model` plus
`@Parent`. A list-shaped field, frequent updates, or convenient whole-document storage is never sufficient reason to
use `@Member`.

## Loading

```java
Project project = Fluxzero.loadModel(projectId).get();

Graph<Project> graph = Fluxzero.loadGraph(projectId);
Project sameProject = graph.get();
List<Task> tasks = graph.childModels("tasks", Task.class);
Graph<Project> previous = graph.previous();
```

Prefer direct `T` injection when only the current value is needed. Inject `Graph<T>` when code needs parents,
children, descendants, history or staged updates. Resolving the graph itself costs the same model load as direct value
injection; relationships are fetched only when traversed. Typed ancestor lookup follows relationship identities first
and loads only the selected ancestor value. Every child is itself a graph, so `parent()`, `root()`,
`previous()`, `atStateIndex(...)`, `apply(...)` and `assertAndApply(...)` remain available at every placement.

Use `graph.delete()` to stage logical deletion of a selected node; return or explicitly commit that resulting graph
according to the surrounding handler contract.

Use `optional()`, `map(...)`, `mapIfPresent(...)` or `filterPresent()` for wrapper/value handling that must not load
relationships. `stream()` walks every placement lazily in deterministic order; `find(idOrAlias)` and
`find(idOrAlias, ModelType.class)` search primary IDs and `@Alias` values without hard-coding paths. For event-driven
before/after logic, use `previous()`, `hasChanged(selector)`, `previousValue(selector)` or `revisions()`. These APIs keep
`Entity<T>` as a persistence/legacy-aggregate detail rather than a normal handler parameter.

Returning a `Graph<T>` from a handler serializes the current model plus all explicitly named relationship paths.
Pathless relations remain queryable through the typed graph API but are intentionally absent from that JSON shape.
Use `selectPaths(...)`, `filterNodes(...)` or ancestor-preserving `filterBranches(...)` for immutable response views;
accepted model values are shared.
Annotate a model method with `@GraphProperty` when a serialized property is derived from the current graph or a typed
ancestor graph. It is evaluated only during graph serialization and reuses the graph already in memory.

Use `@Alias` for a current alternative identity of an independently stored model:

```java
@Model
record Project(
        @EntityId ProjectId projectId,
        @Alias(prefix = "external:") String externalId) {
}

Project project = Fluxzero.loadModel("external:123", Project.class).get();
```

The complete alias set is replaced atomically with each transition. Independent-model aliases are global and must be
unique; primary model IDs take precedence over equal aliases.

Current loads use the model cache and its long-polling update tracker. Event handlers use the event's exact model-commit
boundary:

```java
@HandleEvent
void on(RenameProject event,
        Project project,
        Graph<Project> graph) {
    // Exact state after this event, not latest state.
}
```

Directly affected event/notification models support `T` and `Graph<T>`. Use `Graph<T>` to observe an absent model after
logical deletion or to compare `get()` with `previous()`. An ordinary indexed event without model-commit metadata may
inject directly addressed Models at one current pinned boundary. If a migration has linked that global event to a
Model commit, the same injection resolves its exact historical state instead. Such an event is not implicitly a
complete graph-change subscription; that requires the durable Model commit metadata.

## Search and graph composition

Direct searchable-model documents are synchronous with successful commit completion:

```java
List<Task> open = Fluxzero.search(Task.class)
        .match(false, "completed")
        .fetchAll();
```

Filter by current related documents:

```java
List<Task> tasks = Fluxzero.search(Task.class)
        .whereAncestor(
                Project.class,
                MatchConstraint.match(
                        "active", "status"))
        .fetchAll(Task.class);
```

Use `whereParent`, `whereAncestor`, `whereChild` and `whereDescendant`. Use
class-based relationship constraints for selective parent or Graph search through either a searchable child or a
type-isolated private Graph component; Fluxzero searches matching child IDs before traversing relationships and
composing targets. Prefer `searchGraph(Root.class).whereDescendant(Child.class, constraint)` over a broad forced-live
nested-path filter when the child type is known. Use
`searchGraph(Root.class).stream()` for complete typed lazy `Graph<Root>` results without a cast or type witness. It
reads a configured `@GraphProjection` by default and otherwise stitches current direct documents live;
`searchGraph(Root.class, true)`
forces live composition. Use `fetch(..., ObjectNode.class)` for explicit raw JSON. Enable materialization with
`@Model(searchable = true, materializeGraph = true)`. A blank projection collection derives
`<resolved model collection>-graphs`; explicit lower-level composition limits fail rather than returning a partial
graph.

## Conflict policy

Model commits default to `ModelConflictPolicy.DEFAULT`, resolved from apply/model, builder configuration or application
properties. Public policies are:

- `ACCEPT`: preserve the event once; rebase derived documents and relationships on current merged model state.
- `RETRY`: reload and rerun assertions/interceptors/applies.
- `FAIL`: return the conflict.

If multiple applies request different policies, the stricter applicable policy wins; failure is not weakened by retry.

## Deletion

- Returning `null` from `@Apply` is logical deletion and preserves history.
- Logical parent deletion recursively deletes children whose relevant `@Parent` keeps the default
  `deleteOnParentDeletion = true`. This follows pathless relations and shared descendants too; a shared descendant is
  deleted when any owning parent disappears. Moving a child away in the same atomic commit preserves it.
- `modelRepository().deleteModel(id, NONE)` physically erases that model's stream, current document, snapshots and
  cache state while leaving the global event log untouched.
- Physical descendant erasure remains a separate destructive operation and requires `planDeletion(...)` followed by
  confirmation/execution of that exact plan.
- Erasure fences prevent delayed document, snapshot or projection writes from resurrecting deleted data.
- Detached descendants remain discoverable through deleted-parent lineage for later GDPR/lifecycle erasure.

## Testing

Cover model behavior through commands and observable results:

```java
TestFixture.create()
        .givenCommands(
                new CreateProject(projectId, details))
        .whenCommand(
                new RenameProject(projectId, "New"))
        .expectEvents(
                new RenameProject(projectId, "New"))
        .expectThat(fluxzero ->
                assertEquals(
                        "New",
                        Fluxzero.loadModel(projectId)
                                .get().details().name()));
```

For relationship and persistence changes, also cover direct search, modelstream reconstruction, logical/hard deletion,
event-boundary injection and a real runtime integration flow.

## Legacy note

Do not migrate an existing `@Aggregate` by changing only its annotation: streams, documents, lifecycle and identity
boundaries change. Keep old persisted aggregate code on the 1.x compatibility API until a deliberate data migration.
For an event-sourced backfill, configure `PublishedEventModelMigration` with a stable name, isolated client, legacy
serializer/upcasters and the replacement Model packages or types. Run it without arguments for replay and as
`adopt <cutover-event-index>` for cutover. The SDK-owned consumer is always global, synchronous, single-tracker and
fail-fast; it completes each Model commit before advancing its durable position, and replicas with the same name
provide failover. Replay runs payload then Model `@Apply`, retains the original event index and message ID, does not
republish, and is idempotent. It does not recover legacy `STORE_ONLY` events. A listener application that gradually
moves legacy event handlers to Model/Graph injection should configure its owning repository with
`followPublishedEventMigration(theSameName)`. Mapped events stay on the ordinary read path; only a missing mapping waits
for the durable consumer and then retries exactly. Keep legacy Aggregates as the sole write owner during this read
phase, and do not let moved listeners apply changes back to them.
Document-backed Models are rebuilt in invisible staging; adoption through the owning `ModelRepository` upcasts and
compares every staged and production value, atomically adopts only unchanged equal results without rewriting existing
documents, and rebuilds declared materialized Graphs.
The accepted normalized source remains isolated from later staging until the first ordinary Model write, so resumed
legacy traffic can be caught up and re-adopted without using unverified document content in materialized Graph
composition. Repeat the plural operation to resume a partial cutover. Switch command ownership only after catch-up,
exact state and Graph comparisons, converted listeners and representative performance all report `GO`. The first
ordinary Model write makes recovery forward-only; durable Model commit history may feed an application-specific
emergency legacy projection, but there is no generic post-write rollback contract.
All new examples and implementations should use `@Model`.
