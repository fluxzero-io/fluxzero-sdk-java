This\n is particularly useful when a collection contains many documents and statistics about those documents are required\n frequently.\n <p>\n The facet value is determined as follows:\n <p>\n 1) in case the object is null or a blank string the facet is ignored;\n <p>\n 2) in case the object is a collection, facets are created for each of the collection elements;\n <p>\n 3) in case the object is a map, facets are created for each of the map values. Keys of the map are appended to the\n facet name (including a delimiting slash);\n <p>\n 4) in case the class of the element is annotated with {@link Facet}, the toString() value of the element is used;\n <p>\n 5) in case the object is a constant value (number, string or boolean), the toString() value of the element is used;\n <p>\n 6) for other values, nested facets are collected by inspecting all annotated properties of the object. If the object\n contains any facets these will be included as well. Names of nested facets will be appended to the parent facet name\n (including a delimiting slash);\n <p>\n 7) in other cases the toString() value of the element is used.\n",
