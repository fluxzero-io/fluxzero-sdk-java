# Fluxzero AI Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Before starting any task, you MUST read all rules in the [.aiassistant/rules](.aiassistant/rules) directory.**

These files are the **absolute source of truth** for this project. Do not generalize or guess patterns that differ from these files.

## Required Files to Read

Check the folder `.aiassistant/rules` for:
- `guidelines.md`: Common guidelines for Fluxzero projects.
- `fluxzero.md`: Philosophy and core concepts of Fluxzero.
- `code-samples.md`: Canonical examples of commands, queries, entity modeling, endpoints, and tests.
- `fluxzero-fqns-grouped.txt`: Java imports. Always use these, never make up imports.
